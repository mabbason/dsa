Exercises
 The following exercises provide you with the opportunity to practice with binary search. The solutions to these exercises are found in the section,  Chapter 2  .

 1  How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number 8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13] ?
  - 4 steps, searching from the front of the array

 2  How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?
  - 1 step, length/2 = 3.5, round off = 4th element @ idx 3, just happens to be 8 

 3  What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000?
  10,000 = 13 steps
  20,000 = 14 steps
  40,000:15 steps
  80k : 16
  160k : 17 --> so maximum of 17 steps

  hmm, I was wrong, I did it the wrong way. I should have done...
