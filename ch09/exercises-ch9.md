Exercises
 The following exercises provide you with the opportunity to practice with stacks and queues. The solutions to these exercises are found in the section,  Chapter 9  .
 # 1  If you were writing software for a call center that places callers on hold and then assigns them to “the next available representative,” would you use a stack or a queue?
**response**
A queue, so that the first one in would be the first one out.

 # 2  If you pushed numbers onto a stack in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then popped two items, which number would you be able to read from the stack?
**response**
4 would be the next number to read on the stack after 6, and then 5 were popped off

 # 3  If you inserted numbers into a queue in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then dequeued two items, which number would you be able to read from the queue?
